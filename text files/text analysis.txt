gender wise:
One of the primary reasons for this issue is the burden of household responsibilities, which often disproportionately falls on daughters due to
 parents and older siblings working. Additionally, schools in India encounter numerous challenges in addressing menstruation-related issues, 
including inadequate resources, lack of proper health education, and prevailing taboos about menstruation being considered "unclean." Consequently, 
many girls either drop out of school or experience extended absences during their middle school years due to menstruation cycles.
age wise:
The main reasons for dropouts of children are these states often have higher levels of poverty, and many families struggle to afford the costs
 associated with education, including school fees, books, uniforms, and transportation. The need for children to contribute to family income can lead to early dropouts. 
Many families in these states may not fully recognize the long-term benefits of education and the lack of proper infrastructure can also cause this.
caste wise:
Social issues, caste-based discrimination, and cultural factors can also play a significant role in dropout rates.
 Discrimination can discourage marginalized groups from pursuing education. These factors can cause children to have emotional scars and not have a 
healthy relationship with learning.
standard wise:
Many families struggle with poverty, and when students reach higher standards,
 the financial burden of education often becomes too heavy. Families may prioritize immediate income needs over continuing 
their child's education, leading to dropouts. Many students in rural areas may not fully understand the long-term benefits of higher education, leading to a lack of mot
ivation to pursue education beyond a certain point.
school wise:
Schools with inadequate teaching resources, outdated curriculum, or poor infrastructure may fail to engage students, leading to higher dropout rates. 
Overcrowded classrooms and limited teacher-student interaction can hinder learning and increase dropout risk. Schools in economically disadvantaged areas may struggle to provide
 necessary resources, making it challenging for students to continue their education.
area wise:
Many government schools in rural areas suffer from a lack of qualified teachers, 
inadequate teaching materials and infrastructure. This often results in a poor quality of education, making students disinterested in continuing their studies. 
Many government schools lack basic facilities such as clean drinking water, separate toilets for girls, and electricity, this leads children suffering from various health issues 
which in turn increase the rate of dropouts.
